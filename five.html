                        The Samajwadi Party and the Congress will fight the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections together, in a move that both parties hope will help them consolidate the Muslim vote, a significant 19 per cent of the electorate.

                        After days of wrangling over the distribution of seats, the two parties agreed on a seat sharing formula under which the Congress will contest 105 seats while the SP will battle it out in 298 seats under Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

                        Downing Street said she would set out 12 negotiating objectives.
                        The government has so far revealed few details about what it wants to secure from the Brexit talks.-->
